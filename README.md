# Cocktail_Assistant
This project is a Python-based chat app integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with a vector database to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for cocktail recommendations and information. It offers a simple web interface where users can ask cocktail-related questions, get personalized suggestions, and explore drink recipes.
